Recently I've been reading the book [Top Dog][0]****[by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman][0] and I've learned a few interesting things that have really encouraged me to continue to stat my female athletes in practice and let them compete on a daily basis for the top spots on their teams. Let me share 2 main ideas that have intrigued me and have encouraged me to think about the idea that female athletes benefit from competition in practice, though it may not always make them the most comfortable.

Please forgive the brief summary. Read the book for greater detail if this is not enough information.

1. Research shows that one of the things that contributes to our competitive nature is a gene in our DNA called the COMT gene that codes for the manufacture of a dopamine clearing chemical. Now COMT is special because it works to clear dopamine from the prefrontal cortex instead of the rest of the brain. And this part of the brain affects how we compete to a large degree. When dopamine is present in the prefrontal cortex is contributes to a lack of competitive drive. Those that have high levels of dopamine in this part of their brain typically will be better planners but be less able to deal with stress in new situations. The book refers to these people as "Worriers" and indicates that women are automatically predisposed to be more of a "Worrier" than a man because the excess estrogen in their body inhibits dopamine reabsorption by about 30%. Research indicates that women are more risk averse because of this, but they are also more likely to be successful in many situations because they choose the battles that they are more likely to win, while the men typically will fight battles no matter the unfavorable odds and will therefore lose more often. The people with dopamine clearing ability are called "Warriors," and they are better at handling stress in new situations because they are not risk averse. They do not shut down under pressure because their bodies don't have a dopamine buildup that causes a type of shut down in the prefrontal cortex. Surprisingly, "Worriers" that are exposed to high levels of stress on a repeated basis actually perform better than "Warriors" exposed to the same tests because the "Warriors" have not been able to build up as much "working memory" and can't use their "planning" skills as well to deal with a similar stress.
2. When entrepreneur's ring fingers are compared to their index fingers, data shows that the bigger the difference, the more successful, on average, the entrepreneur will be. This is even more true for women than men. Most women have ring fingers and index fingers that are the same length, but women with longer ring fingers are much more likely to be a successful entrepreneur. Risk taking is correlated with finger length because fetal ring fingers have more receptors for testosterone than index fingers. When testosterone is released into the fetal body from the mother it causes the ring finger to grow more. It also affects the parts of brain development that tend to help someone be a better competitor. The more testosterone that is given to a fetal body, the more responsive a person will be to testosterone being released into their body in the future. So, having a longer ring finger may ultimately correlate to how well your brain will clear the dopamine from your body.

Because of point \#1 I believe that exposing our players to repeated competition with points scored in practice and ranking them is an excellent way to introduce stress that is similar to a game and will still be fun for the players. Anson Dorrance, arguably the best coach in NCAA history, found great success with his UNC women's soccer team by using this method.

Because of point \#2 I am just a bit more convinced that women, in general, may be genetically predisposed to being "Worriers" which again would support the idea that women will benefit more from competition in practice so that they can be ready for the stresses of a game without shutting down.

I hope you have found this fascinating to contemplate. I am currently exploring this concept as I learn more, but with the success of Anson Dorrance and the Gold Medal Squared system I am even more inclined to implement this competition format in practice than ever before.

God Bless,

Chris Powers
