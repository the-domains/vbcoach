            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that I've learned over the last few months is that very few kids seem to understand their roles on a team. Most of the girls I've talked to seem to understand the positions on the court as roles. They think the roles are OH, MB, S, L, RS. When it comes down to it,if the player only sees those positions as the roles, then they begin to feel very little value while the team is in a game situation and they aren't playing. At the end of the season, they can feel very unfulfilled. If they see that they aren't going to get playing time in the next season, they may quit the team, even though they were one of the primary reasons that the team was successful. We can look at the rosters of nearly any team in the sports world and realize that there are plenty of players that do not experience much, if any, game time. Being on a team is not about playing time in games, but if we don't teach the players the value of their roles, and the importance of practicing hard, then the players will leave the team without ever fully having understood this. Because of this, it is important that players start to see that their role goes much deeper and is even more important for the overall success of the team.</p>]]></description>
