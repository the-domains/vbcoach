<p>Helping Every Kid Understand Their Role on a Team</p><p>One of the things that I've learned over the last few months is that very few kids seem to understand their roles on a team. Most of the girls I've talked to seem to understand the positions on the court as roles. They think the roles are OH, MB, S, L, RS. When it comes down to it,<em><strong>if </strong></em>the player only sees those positions as the roles, then they begin to feel very little value while the team is in a game situation and they aren't playing. At the end of the season, they can feel very unfulfilled. If they see that they aren't going to get playing time in the next season, they may quit the team, even though they were one of the primary reasons that the team was successful. We can look at the rosters of nearly any team in the sports world and realize that there are plenty of players that do not experience much, if any, game time. Being on a team is not about playing time in games, but if we don't teach the players the value of their roles, and the importance of practicing hard, then the players will leave the team without ever fully having understood this. Because of this, it is important that players start to see that their role goes much deeper and is even more important for the overall success of the team.</p><p>One of the many models for understanding our personality types is the DISC model. Using this model, one can get an understanding of the types of roles that a player may have on a team that are not oriented around getting playing time in a game. If you are a parent, read through this and help your players start to understand what other roles they have on a team besides positions on the court. If you are a coach, start to implement this into your player evaluations. Help them to see how they are valuable to the team even when they aren't getting game time. Go through these with your players as a group and let the other players identify each other according to different roles. Some girls will start to see that they have been contributing to the team in ways that they didn't even realize.</p><p>I pulled the following model from this web site. It will go into more detail if you are interested.<a href="http://www.athleteassessments.com/articles/GRIP_Model_Roles_in_Teams_Sport.html" data-mce-href="http://www.athleteassessments.com/articles/GRIP_Model_Roles_in_Teams_Sport.html">http://www.athleteassessments.com/articles/GRIP_Model_Roles_in_Teams_Sport.html</a></p><p>Thanks for your time....</p><p>--Chris Powers</p><picture>
